            <p>General
        </h3>
        <p> Kwik EFIS is a suite of applications which implement a <b>Glass Cockpit</b> solution 
            designed to function on most Android devices equipped with a GPS,
            gyroscope, accelerometer and a CPU with reasonable performance.

         The suite currently consist of two applications:
            <li> Primary Flight Display (PFD), Kwik EFIS and;
            <li> Multi Function Display (MFD) digital moving map, Kwik DMAP
            
        <p>
            <a href="img/image003-shd.png"> <img width=320 hspace="10" align="right" src="img/image003-shd.png"> </a>

         <p> &nbsp 
        <p>The primary display is modeled on modern EFSI displays. A central 
        attitude indicator bordered by altitude and ground speed tapes. 
        True track is displayed at the top of the screen, and the slip ball at the bottom. 
        V speeds are displayed according to the selected aircraft.
        <p> &nbsp
        
        <h4>Flight Director</h4>
        <p>Kwik EFIS has a fully functional flight director built in. It uses the standard V-Bar
            symbology common to modern flight directors. The target waypoint and altitude is set
            on-screen
            by means of the <i>spinner</i> controls on the right top and bottom of the screen.

        <h4>ADS-B/AHRS</h4>
        <p>In addition to the internal sensors, a low cost Stratux ADS-B/AHRS can be selected as the
           input source. See <a href="http://www.stratux.me">Stratux ADS-B</a> for more information.  

        <h4>Demo Mode</h4>
        <p>There is also a simulation mode available in the application. 
            The Flight director is used to select a waypoint and altitude and the simulator will generate
            the GPS movements to navigate to the selected waypoint. 
            The speed is constant at 192kt.
