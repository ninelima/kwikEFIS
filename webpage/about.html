            <p>General
        </h3>
        <p> Kwik EFIS is a suite of applications which implement a <b>Glass Cockpit</b> solution 
            designed to function on most Android devices equipped with a GPS,
            gyroscope, accelerometer and a CPU with reasonable performance.

         The suite currently consist of two applications:
            <li> Primary Flight Display (PFD), Kwik EFIS and;
            <li> Multi Function Display (MFD) digital moving map, Kwik DMAP
            
        <p>
            <a href="img/image003-shd.png"> <img width=320 hspace="10" align="right" src="img/image003-shd.png"> </a>


        <p>Initial test flights with Kwik EFIS has been encouraging.

            Results are better on the Nexus 7 tablet then the Galaxy S2 phone but
            that is to be expected since the sensors on the various Android devices vary greatly
            in quality and performance.

        <p> The slip/roll coupling uses a low pass filter on all the sensors.
            This helps with some of the inferior gyroscrope and accelerometer sensors on some of the
            cheaper Android
            devices.


        <h4>Flight Director</h4>
        <p>Kwik EFIS has a fully functional flight director built in. It uses the standard V-Bar
            symbology common to modern flight directors. The target waypoint and altitude is set
            on-screen
            by means of the <i>spinner</i> controls on the right top and bottom of the screen.

        <h4>Demo Mode</h4>
        <p>There is also a "Demo Mode" available in the application. It is fairly rudimentary and
            basically works like a crude flight simulator.
            The heading and altitude can be changed by pitching and banking the device. The speed
            runs up and down automatically based on the pitch.
